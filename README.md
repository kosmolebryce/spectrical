## Spectrical: Chemical Shift Reference Tool

### Overview

Spectrical is a simple GUI application, built on the Python standard library's `tkinter` GUI framework. Simply input a comma- or line-delimited list of chemical shifts in parts per million (ppm). The output presents examples of functional groups that could correspond to each of the provided chemical shift values.

### Roadmap

**[HIGH PRIORITY]**
[ ] Implement more robust methods for interpreting various combinations of chemical shifts in NMR data sets
[ ] Enhance the UI's visual appeal
[ ] Add a menu bar to facilitate configurability
